Direct-BT License & Copyright
===============================
The MIT License (MIT) (see above)

BSD License covering TinyCrypt (see below)

Direct-BT imports certain information from Linux Kernel's BlueZ protocol stack,
originating from Qualcomm's sources under MIT license.
This information enables the use of certain kernel services via system calls.
Therefore, the license of this file has been aligned with this project's MIT license.
 
Related files are
- <api/direct_bt/BTIoctl.hpp>,
- <api/direct_bt/HCIIoctl.hpp> and 
- <api/direct_bt/L2CAPIoctl.hpp>.

Notice Qualcomm's original MIT license of the respective files.

Also notice Linus Torvalds's Linux Kernel license exception regarding kernel syscalls (ioctl):
<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/LICENSES/exceptions/Linux-syscall-note>
and therefor <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.20/process/license-rules.html>.

<quote>
 NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
 services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
 of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".
</quote>
 
Given the syscall usage and original file's MIT license, 
we assume the following SPDX-License-Identifier should be declared: 
"SPDX-License-Identifier: (GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note) AND MIT"
 
...

This documentation of our usage is certainly better than GOOG's approach: 
<https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bluetooth/+/eclair-release/bluez-clean-headers/bluetooth?autodive=0/>,
which removes all authorship and origin.

============================
Direct-BT was initially developed as an 
alternative implementation to TinyB's Java API.

The latter was developed by the Intel Corporation
and licensed under the MIT license.
Main authors of TinyB were:
- Petre Eftime <petre.p.eftime@intel.com>
- Andrei Vasiliu <andrei.vasiliu@intel.com>

Today, TinyB has been removed from this project.

This copyright notice shall stay,
since some code fragments and portions of the infrastructure 
contains their work.
